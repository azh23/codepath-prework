# Prework - Color Changing Button

Submitted by: **Alana Zhao**

**Color Changing Button** is an app that lists my name, university, and 
aspirational job. It also contains a button that changes the background color
as well as the button's color when pressed. 

Time spent: **0.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Books
-> Super simplistic and straightforward design. 
-> Tells you information about a book like percentage progress and pages left
   in chapter, something that you wouldn't have in a physical situation.

2. Youtube
-> the ability to have your current video as a small window at the bottom of
   the page while you scroll your recommended videos.
-> As you scroll up, the top bar reappears, and as you scroll down, it 
   disappears. 
   
3. Safari
-> the ability to sort your tabs into separate named groups + ease of access
-> the way tabs are organized

I love cats, so I would want to create an app organizing different breeds of
cats for those either 1. considering to get a cat or 2. wishing to identify
the breed of a cat. It would feature their fur length, patterns, temperament,
etc. Additionally, it would encourage the user to donate to or adopt from their
local shelter or rescue. You would be able to 'search' the breeds and also
fill out a questionnaire to help match a cat to you.

## Notes

A majority of online tutorials regarding changing the color of the button are
 related to the backgroundColor attribute. I had trouble finding a way to 
 change the fill specifically.
